# RFID-based-Door-Access
The arduino based RFID door lock system is secure and responsive as compared to other systems. With the use of arduino, it becomes much easy to design. Program a code and upload it to arduino just like a plug and play device. It is simple and cost efficientproject and can be used as a basic access control mechanism. Their main advantageis contactless communication and RFID tags can work in any environmental conditions. This is the reason RFID systems are more efficient.
